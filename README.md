The customer/emd user describes no one can use the online bank portal and fills out the request.

# Working The Issue
  
Now as help desk agent John, the properties of the ticket are opened and analyzed. As the ticket is being worked a couple things needs to be updated. The system by default has a priority of normal, but that needs to be updated to emergency priority as a banking portal is very important!

<p>
- The next step we must do is to update the SLA plan on the ticket to Sev-A because in this case a down online banking portal is of major impact and must be worked within a 1 hour timeframe. 

- Updating the help topic to business critical outage is also important to note.

- Assigning the ticket to the corresponding department is reflected in the following picture.

# Resolution

In the following image we can see the transfer of the ticket that belonged to a member of support but is taken over by the online banking team. Specifically the Sysadmin Jane takes over the ticket.

After connecting with the sysadmin department, Jane looks into the problem and updates the ticket.

Jane updates the ticket by providing a solution, which effectively resolves the ticket in the image below.
